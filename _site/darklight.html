                <p>DarkLight is a 3D horror game in which players explorer a dark and foreboding labyrinth while 
evading the sinister spirits that lurk within. The shining light that illuminates your surroundings is also a 
shroud that conceals looming phantoms. <br>
<br>
This game was created as a rapid prototype over just two weeks for EECS 494: Video Game Design and Development, 
a course at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. The central mechanic of the game is that the enemies 
that dissappear if the player shines their light on them. This forces the player to choose between gaining information
about their surroundings using light, or keeping an eye on their enemies. Another mechanic that contributes to the horror
is the enemies only move when the player cannot see them. <br>
<br>
All art and sound assets were acquired from outside sources (with some editing).

                            <li>If navigation is part of the challenge of a game, the level's different areas should be unique enough for the player to form a mental map</li>
                        
                            <li>Simple random generation is useful to create early testing maps without investing time into level design early on in the project</li>
