                <p>Equinox: Security Breach is an asymmetric 4-player co-op stealth action shooter.
 We managed to cram that many genres into one game by splitting players into two teams
 with distinct experiences. One team, called the defenders, is tasked with hunting down
 their two opponents and blasting them away with laser guns. The other team, called the infiltrators,
 must evade the defenders and hack terminals to win. All four characters have unique abilities, which
 adds asymmetry within each team.<br>
 <br>
 Equinox was developed as a capstone project for EECS 494: Video Game Design and Development, a course
  at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. A main objective of the design was for it to be successful at
  the end-of-semester showcase for the class.
