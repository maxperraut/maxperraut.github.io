    DarkLight is a 3D horror game in which players explorer a dark and foreboding labyrinth while 
    evading the sinister spirits that lurk within. The shining light that illuminates your surroundings is also a 
    shroud that conceals looming phantoms. <br>
    <br>
    This game was created as a rapid prototype over two weeks for EECS 494: Video Game Design and Development, 
    a course at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. The central mechanic of the game is that the enemies 
    that dissappear if the player shines their light on them. This forces the player to choose between gaining information
    about their surroundings using light, or keeping an eye on their enemies. Another mechanic that contributes to the horror
    is the enemies only move when the player cannot see them. <br>
    <br>
    All art and sound assets were acquired from outside sources (with some editing).

tasks:
    - Enemy spawning and behavior
    - Light hiding enemies mechanic
    - Level design
    - First-person camera and movement control
    - Player guidance
    - Implementation of art and sound assets

successes:
    - The gameplay evokes feelings of fear and uncertainty
    - As a prototype, the central light-based mechanic is explored well and is proven to have potential
    - The horror tone of the game is strongly expressed through the level design, art, and sound
challenges:
    - The balancing act between explaining a horror game's mechanics to the player, and not telling them so much that it ceases to be scary
    - Managing enemy spawning to apply enough pressure to be thrilling without feeling unfair
    - Creating a level that is challenging to navigate without players getting completely lost
lessons:
    - Sound effects and ambient sounds are essential for creating a horror atmosphere.
    - If navigation is part of the challenge of a game, the level's different areas should be unique enough for the player to form a mental map
    - Simple random generation is useful to create early testing maps without investing time into level design early on in the project
