    Equinox: Security Breach is an asymmetric 4-player co-op stealth action shooter.
     We managed to cram that many genres into one game by splitting players into two teams
     with distinct experiences. One team, called the defenders, is tasked with hunting down
     their two opponents and blasting them away with laser guns. The other team, called the infiltrators,
     must evade the defenders and hack terminals to win. All four characters have unique abilities, which
     adds asymmetry within each team.<br>
     <br>
     Equinox was developed as a capstone project for EECS 494: Video Game Design and Development, a course
      at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. A main objective of the design was for it to be successful at
      the end-of-semester showcase for the class.

tasks:
    - Player input
    - Control
    - Terminal hacking
    - Game manager (objective progress, score, changing rounds)
    - EMP ability
    - Minimap
    - Tutorial
    - Assisted teammates in design of all other game components

successes:
    - Four interesting and useful abilities
    - Round-based objective and game progression
    - Effective dark/stealth theming
    - Excellent visuals given time and resources
challenges:
    - Balancing game around varying skill levels
    - Making both teams equally fun to play
    - Teaching game mechanics to new players given limited playtime for a showcase game
lessons:
    - Conveying the theme through visuals and audio is essential for players to quickly understand what type of game they are playing
    - Maintaining modularity/independence between game systems allows for easier iteration
    - Asymmetry between teams in a multiplayer game makes balance significantly harder to actieve
